Organization of the catalogue
-----------------------------

The database is organized on 4 hierarchical levels of description: Archives Series (Fonds) > Corpus > Collection > Item. The main level of description is ‘Collection’. Each gathers a relevant ensemble of sound items corresponding to recordings collected within one research fieldwork or to a published record. Some collections are assembled together in corpuses and archive groups linked to their collectors. 

The number of recordings available online on the platform is constantly increasing. The platform’s users fill descriptive forms collaboratively: researchers, students, archivists working together. The CREM welcomes all collaborations aiming to enrich and enhance this valued musical patrimony. You can write to us at crem.lesc (at) mae.u-paris10.fr.
