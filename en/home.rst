The audio archives of the CNRS – Musée de l’Homme gather commercial and unpublished recordings of music and oral traditions from around the world, from 1900 to the present.  Consisting of diverse types of media (wax cylinders, 78 rpm, vinyl records, magnetic tapes, audio CDs, born digital records), these archives are among the most important in Europe in terms of quality, quantity and diversity.

Organization of the catalogue
-----------------------------

The database is organized on 4 hierarchical levels of description: Archives Series (Fonds) > Corpus > Collection > Item. The main level of description is ‘Collection’. Each gathers a relevant ensemble of sound items corresponding to recordings collected within one research fieldwork or to a published record. Some collections are assembled together in corpuses and archive groups linked to their collectors. 

The number of recordings available online on the platform is constantly increasing. They are indicated by a speaker. The platform’s users fill descriptive forms collaboratively and gradually : researchers, students, archivists working together. The CREM welcomes all collaborations aiming to enrich and enhance this valued musical patrimony. You can write to us at crem.lesc (at) cnrs.fr.
